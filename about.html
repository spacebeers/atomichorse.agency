        <h1>Who the f are we?</h1>

        <p>Established in 2018 as a way of our founder Andy being able to justify getting a dog by working at home more - we have gone from strength to strength. </p>
            
        <p>We believe our mix of agency, freelance and enterprise level experience gives us a compelling worldview of the digital landscape. From websites of a single page to local businesses to household name travel brands - our development team have done it all. </p>

        <p>Our specialty is providing the highest possible level of web site development for small businesses, designers and digital agencies. We work remotely mainly but can embed inside a business if you prefer. We’re nothing if not adaptable. </p>

        <p>With over 15 years experience in web development we have extensive contacts in design, UX, analytics and copywriting that we can call on when a project needs it. We feel this collective approach makes us stand out from the rest of the pack (I can’t think of good horse joke here but I feel there is one) and means we can provide you with the best solution to your problems.</p>

        <p>If you would like to work with us (or have any good horse jokes) please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> and we will be in touch as soon as possible. </p>
